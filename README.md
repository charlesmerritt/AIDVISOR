AIDVISOR is our New Media Capstone project dedicated to leveraging LLMs and the OpenAI Assistants API to provide financial aid equity and improve access to scholarships, grants, and other resources for students.
Initially prototyped with Gradio, we pivoted towards a Django app leveraging a new frontend and SQLite database which brings real users into frame.
